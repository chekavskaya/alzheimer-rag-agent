"ABSTRACT: Growing evidence underscores the critical role of lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously demonstrated that 5xFAD mice exhibit a marked accumulation of ganglioside GM3 in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus as the disease progresses, with this increase being more pronounced in females than in males. However, the specific brain cell types exhibiting elevated GM3 accumulation, along with GM3's underlying molecular mechanisms and functional signific",41651693,Microglial GM3 accumulation impairs Aβ phagocytic activity and promotes neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.
"elevated GM3 accumulation, along with GM3's underlying molecular mechanisms and functional significance in AD pathogenesis, remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we report that elevated GM3 levels in 5xFAD are associated with increased expression of Hexa and Hexb-which encode the α- and β-subunits, respectively, of lysosomal β-hexosaminidase A (HexA), the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of GM2 to GM3 within lysosomes-but not with St3gal5.

"ABSTRACT: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is one of the most important therapeutic targets in the treatment of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. In recent years, studies on the use of carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease have attracted considerable attention. In this study, novel benzene/5-HMF-chalcone hybrids and their benzoate esters were synthesized. Furthermore, the AChE, carbonic anhydrases I and II (CA I and II) inhibition potentials of t",41645578,Acetylcholinesterase and Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibition Profiles of New 5-HMF Chalcones and Their Ester Derivatives.

Furthermore, the AChE, carbonic anhydrases I and II (CA I and II) inhibition potentials of the compounds were evaluated through in vitro enzyme inhibition assays and molecular docking studies to identify new potential drug candidate molecules. According to the inhibition results, the Ki values of the synthesized compounds were found to be in the range of 1.51-2.91 nM against AChE, 26.15-68.66 nM against CA I, and 27.91-107.04 nM against CA II.

Molecular docking studies revealed that the compounds bind to both the catalytic active site (CAS) and the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE, with Glide scores ranging from -5.76 to -8.50 kcal/mol. In contrast, the molecules interacted with the active site of CA I/II by coordinating with the catalytic Zn2+ ion. All compounds complied with Lipinski's Rule of Five, indicating favorable drug-like properties.

"ABSTRACT: Defective Wnt/β-catenin signaling is closely associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), thus validating this pathway as a therapeutic target for AD. ISX9 is a potent agonist of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. However, it remains unknown whether ISX9 exerts anti-AD effects by enhancing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. We therefore explored the neuroprotective potential of ISX9 using both hippocampal neuron-derived HT22 cells and 5×FAD transgenic mouse model of AD.",41645328,ISX9 activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and exerts neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's disease.

"ABSTRACT: Tauopathy, including Alzheimer's Disease, is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, yet current therapies fail to halt disease progression, partly due to limited understanding of early Tau pathological structures. Cryo-electron microscopy has clarified distinct Tau structures tied to disease phenotypes, but only in their mature forms and at low throughput. Hence, molecular probes that can recognize early Tau conformations in high throughput and in situ hold the potential to tra",41643771,Conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies reveal early Tau structural intermediates in Alzheimer's disease.
